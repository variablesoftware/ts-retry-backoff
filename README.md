## 🌐 Inclusive & Accessible Design

- Naming, logging, error messages, and tests avoid cultural or ableist bias
- Avoids assumptions about input/output formats or encodings
- Faithfully reflects user data — no coercion or silent transformations
- Designed for clarity, predictability, and parity with underlying platforms (e.g., Cloudflare APIs)
- Works well in diverse, multilingual, and inclusive developer environments
